# Making an "archive"

Dispite our efforts not to "archive" or "catalog" HEC-RAS models, it's clear that wide scale deployment of HEC-RAS models as inputs to other workflows requires some form of tracking if we hope to maintain reproducibility and accountability.  While formal archives from individuals and organizations might internally align, adding models from outside sources is difficult or impossible due to the differences in the tasks and formats different model producers use.  This friction gave rise to RRASSLER.  By reducing the form of the HEC-RAS data to a unique catalog entry, we can arbitrarily and blindly be handed a HEC-RAS model and place that into the resulting framework or otherwise handle it.  That gives users who need models a standardized starting spot off which to build their own processes.

### Ingest logic

In order to wrassle that friction, RRASSLER has a few theoretical value judgments that need to be described in order to help understand why it does what it does and how to use it properly.  RRASSLER is focused on making the critical data objects needed to run a HEC-RAS model readily available and accountable as a model (as opposed to as individual data points or large clusters of otherwise "vistigal" data; and with an emphasis on the particular geometric realization of the model).  It is also designed to be a standardized and centralized source of models, regardless of their origin.  For that reason, RRASSLER expects to operate within it's own controlled directory, or "HECRAS_model_catalog".   Users first download and unpack desired models into a temporary location, and then point RRASSLER at that directory and the place which you want to store your catalog.  It will:  

1) Greedly scrape the entire directory structure for any HEC-RAS model projects  (defined as *.prj)
2) for each geometric realization of that model (variation of *.g##), grab all files such that:

3) Attempt to place the model in space.  This is done by attempting to parse the g** and g**.hdf files, guess at projections, and pulling and collating the data into an xid-xyz table. 
4) Using that extracted geometry, attempt to create a model footprint (hull).
    5) If that process errors out, the model is appended with a 3_, and placed into the catalog
    6) If the hull was created, we then attempt to joint that model the the reference hydrofabric and locate the "Primary downstream divergence" (the first COMID from the maximum levelpath underneath that footprint).  If that process errors out for any reason, the model is appended with a 1_
    7) If there was no feature to join, the model 
    8) If the model was joined, the ID of the primary downstream divergence is appended to the model key.
    9) If that can be constructed, the model was assumed to be correctly placed in space.  The relevant model files are copied to the uniquely parsed "final_model_name_key" folder under the _/models/_ folder.  
5) If the creation of the model hull errors out, the model is placed in the _/models/_unprocessed_ folder for further investigation, correction, and rewrassling.
6) After all iterations of files are done, RRASSLER will (re)generate a unified source for model footprints, cross sections, and points (now in spatial form) from the HEC-RAS model, and pointers back to the copied source data which remains unaltered. 

This workflow is loosely diagrammed as follows:

Let's take a look at a few "real life" examples of these outputs and how we should interpret them.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JimColl/RRASSLER/main/man/figures/RRASSLER_names.png)

Note that this process is "HECRAS_model_catalog" location agnostic.  Therefore, although you will be operating over local files you may RRASSLE those into ether a local directory or an s3 bucket using the same commands.  RRASSLER also handles all "folder structure" differences between S3 protocols and disk representations, so the "bucket" argument can look just like a folder path or can be the "root" folder in an S3 URL and both are intelligently parsed out.

## The "minimal" catalog entry form

As mentioned, the form of the RRASSL'd record is based on hydrofabric specifications with modifications based on the nature of HEC-RAS data as outlined [with Next Gen hydrofabric parameters](https://noaa-owp.github.io/hydrofabric/articles/cs_dm.html).  These are:
